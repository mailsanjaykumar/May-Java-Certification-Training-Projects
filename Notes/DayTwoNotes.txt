Polymorphism:

	`poly` means Many and `morpho` means Forms.
	
	"One Interface Multiple Functions"
	
	Static Polymorphism: achieved by Overloading
	
	Dynamic Polymorphism: achieved by Overridding
	
------------------------------------------

Overloading:

	A class can have more than one methods with same but different method signatures. There are three ways to differentiate method signatures:
	
	1. Number of parameters
	
		public int addition(int num1, int num2)
		public int addition(int num1, int num2, int num3)
	
	2. Type of parameters
		
		public int addition(int num1, int num2)
		public float addition(float num1, float num2)
	
	3. Sequence of parameters
	
		public float addition(int num1, float num2)
		public float addition(float num1, int num2)

	We overload methods and constructors in Java as per the requirement.
	
-------------------------------------------

Overridding: 

	- Helps to redefine of override the method from parent class. 
	- This can only achieve with the help of inheritance.
	
	To implement or achieve the overriding concept, we use:
	
	- Abstract Classes and Abstract Methods
	- Interfaces
	
--------------------------------------------

Abstract Class and Abstract Method:

	The purpose of abstract class is define the common definition of Base Class that is followed by derived classes as a contract.
	
	- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
	- An abstract class can contain abstract as well as non-abstract methods.
	- An abstract method cannot have its implementation in abstract class.
	- A child class cannot inherit more than abstract or non-abstract classes.
	- Multiple Inheritance cannot be achieved using abstract classes.
	- An abstract method can only be declared in abstract class.
	- All Child/Derived classes must implment all the abstract methods in it.
	
------------------------------------------------

Interface:

	An interface is an contract that can have properties, variables and methods that have to be followed by Child or Derived Classes.
	
	- An interface needs to be implemented.
	- It is not permitted to have access modifer on its method.
	- All methods of an Interface are public and abstract.
	- An interface only contains the declaration or signature of methods.
	- Multiple Inheritance can be achieved using Interfaces
	- An interace can also have default or static methods apart from abstract.

------------------------------------------------

Hint:

	interface IBankAccount
	{
		bool Deposit(double amount);
		bool Withdraw(double amount);
		double Balance();
	}
	
1. Saving Account has a limit to withdraw.
2. Current has no limit.

Note:

	If Balance is less than the withdrawal amount then displays "Insuffient Balance"
	If withdrawal amount is greater than 5000, then "Withdrawal attempts failed"
