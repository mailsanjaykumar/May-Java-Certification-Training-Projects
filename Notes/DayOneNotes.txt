Data Types in Java:

	- Primitive Data Types
	- Reference Data Types
	
-------------------------------------------------------

Object Oriented Programming:

	Key Feature: Data Hidding
	
Features of OOPS:

	- Encapuslating Data
	- Abstracting the Data
	- Code Resuability
	- Defining Contracts or Base for application
	- Reduces the complexity
	
Components of OOPS:

	- Class
	- Object
	- Encapsulation
	- Abstraction
	- Inheritance
	- Polymorphism
	
-------------------------------------------------------

Class:

	A user-defined data type or blueprint.
	A collection of data members and member functions.
	Data Members are the variable at class level.
	Member Functions are the methods at class level.
	Class helps you to define entity of your application.
	
Object:

	An object is a variable of user-defined data type.
	An object is a representator of a class.
	Also, known as an instance or part of a class.
	When we create an object of a class, memory gets allocated to its instance data members.
	
	int num;
	Employee emp = new Employee();
	Employee emp; 	// Reference Variable of Employee Type
	new Employee(); // Creating Object
	
Constructor:

	A special method that is used to initialize the data members of a class.
	The name of the constructor is same as that of the class name.
	They don't even have any return type.
	Constructor is invoked implicitly by compiler.
	
Encapsulation:

	A technique used to implment abstraction in Object Oriented Programming.
	Encapsulation is used for access restriction to class members and methods.

Abstraction:

	A concept of accessing the internal details or describe the members from outside the class body.
	
	
Access Modifiers:

	Private:
	
		This is least accessible access modifier.
		Private Members are accessible within its own class only.
		
	Public:

		This is the most accessible access modifier.
		Public Members can be accessible from anywhere.
	
	Default: 
	
		By Default, default is access modifier for every member.
		Default Members can be accessible within the package or folder anywhere.
		
	Protected:
